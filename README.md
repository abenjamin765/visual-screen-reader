# visual-screen-reader
The purpose of the visual screen reader is to strip away all of the page styling in order to offer a simulation of what a person hears when they visit your site using assistive technology. 

Testing things like tab-order, keyboard controls, and other considerations are made easier using the visual screen reader.
